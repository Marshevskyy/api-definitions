      The payment instrument which is used as a base for the token.
      Essentially, when specified, the token overrides the payment instrument with whatever is provided.
      This is particularly useful when the token is used to do a payment,
      so all the fields of a payment instrument are overridden for a single transaction.
      Such token cannot be applied to a payment instrument.
