          The payment card which is used as a base for the token.
          Essentially, when specified, the token overrides the payment card with whatever is provided.
          This is particularly useful when the token is used to do a payment,
          so all the fields of the payment card are overridden for a single transaction.
          Such token cannot be applied to a payment instrument.
